    "In Chapter 10 you built, trained, and fine-tuned your first artificial neural networks. But they were shallow nets, with just a few hidden layers. What if you need to tackle a complex problem, such as detecting hundreds of types of objects in high-resolution images? You may need to train a much deeper ANN, perhaps with 10 layers or many more, each containing hundreds of neurons, linked by hundreds of thousands of connections. Training a deep neural network isn’t a walk in the park. Here are some of the problems you could run into:\n",

    "## **The Vanishing/Exploding Gradients Problems**\n",
    "As discussed in Chapter 10, the backpropagation algorithm’s second phase works by going from the output layer to the input layer, propagating the error gradient along the way. Once the algorithm has computed the gradient of the cost function with regard to each parameter in the network, it uses these gradients to update each parameter with a gradient descent step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, gradients often get smaller and smaller as the algorithm progresses down to the lower layers. As a result, the gradient descent update leaves the lower layers’ connection weights virtually unchanged, and training never converges to a good solution. This is called the ***vanishing gradients*** problem. In some cases, the opposite can happen: the gradients can grow bigger and bigger until layers get insanely large weight updates and the algorithm diverges. This is the ***exploding gradients*** problem, which surfaces most often in recurrent neural networks (see Chapter 15). More generally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers may learn at widely different speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This unfortunate behavior was empirically observed long ago, and it was one of the reasons deep neural networks were mostly abandoned in the early 2000s. It wasn’t clear what caused the gradients to be so unstable when training a DNN, but some light was shed in a ***2010 paper(https://homl.info/47)*** by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio.  The authors found a few suspects, including the combination of the popular sigmoid (logistic) activation function and the weight initialization technique that was most popular at the time (i.e., a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1). In short, they showed that with this activation function and this initialization scheme, the variance of the outputs of each layer is much greater than the variance of its inputs. Going forward in the network, the variance keeps increasing after each layer until the activation function saturates at the toplayers. This saturation is actually made worse by the fact that the sigmoid function has a mean of 0.5, not 0 (the hyperbolic tangent function has a mean of 0 and behaves slightly better than the sigmoid function in deep networks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the sigmoid activation function, you can see that when inputs become large (negative or positive), the function saturates at 0 or 1, with a derivative extremely close to 0 (i.e., the curve is flat at both extremes). Thus, when backpropagation kicks in it has virtually no gradient to propagate back through the network, and what little gradient exists keeps getting diluted as backpropagation progresses down through the top layers, so there is really nothing left for the lower layers.\n",

    "In their paper, Glorot and Bengio propose a way to significantly alleviate the unstable gradients problem. They point out that we need the signal to flow properly in both directions: in the forward direction when makingpredictions, and in the reverse direction when backpropagating gradients. We don’t want the signal to die out, nor do we want it to explode and saturate. For the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of its inputs,  and we need the gradients to have equal variance before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction (please check out the paper if you are interested in the mathematical details). It is actually not possible to guarantee both unless the layer has an equal number of inputs and outputs (these numbers are called the ***fan-in*** and ***fan-out*** of the layer), but Glorot and Bengio proposed a good compromise that has proven to work very well in practice: the connection weights of each layer must be initialized randomly as described in Equation below, where ***fan<sub>avg</sub> = (fan<sub>in</sub> + fan<sub>out</sub> ) / 2***. This initialization strategy is called ***Xavier initialization*** or ***Glorot initialization***, after the paper’s first author."

    "### **Better Activation Functions**\n",
    "One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that the problems with unstable gradients were in part due to a poor choice of activation function. Until then most people had assumed that if Mother Nature had chosen to use roughly sigmoid activation functions in biological neurons, they must be an excellent choice. But it turns out that other activation functions behave much better in deep neural networks—in particular, the **ReLU** activation function, mostly because it does not saturate for positive values, and also because it is very fast to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the **ReLU** activation function is not perfect. It suffers from a problem known as the ***dying ReLUs***: during training, some neurons effectively “die”, meaning they stop outputting anything other than 0. In some cases, you may find that half of your network’s neurons are dead, especially if you used a large learning rate. A neuron dies when its weights get tweaked in such a way that the input of the **ReLU** function (i.e., the weighted sum of the neuron’s inputs plus its bias term) is negative for all instances in the training set. When this happens, it just keeps outputting zeros, and gradient descent does not affect it anymore because the gradient of the **ReLU** function is zero when its input is negative.\n",

Having a slope for z < 0 ensures that leaky **ReLUs** never die; they can go into a long coma, but they have a chance to eventually wake up. A ***2015 paper(https://homl.info/49)*** by ***Bing Xu et al***. compared several variants of the **ReLU** activation function, and one of its conclusions was that the leaky variants always outperformed the strict ReLU activation function. In fact, setting α = 0.2 (a huge leak) seemed to result in better performance than α = 0.01 (a small leak). The paper also evaluated the ***randomized leaky ReLU*** **(RReLU)**, where α is picked 5 randomly in a given range during training and is fixed to an average value during testing. **RReLU** also performed fairly well and seemed to act as a regularizer, reducing the risk of overfitting the training set. Finally, the paper evaluated the ***parametric leaky ReLU*** **(PReLU)**, where α is authorized to be learned during training: instead of being a hyperparameter, it becomes a parameter that can be modified by backpropagation like any other parameter. **PReLU** was reported to strongly outperform **ReLU** on large image datasets, but on smaller datasets it runs the risk of overfitting the training set.\n",

The authors showed that if you build a neural network composed exclusively of a stack of dense layers (i.e., an MLP), and if all hidden layers use the SELU activation function, then the network will ***self-normalize***: the output of each layer will tend to preserve a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 during training, which solves the vanishing/exploding gradients problem. As a result, the SELU activation function may outperform other activation functions for MLPs, especially deep ones. To use it with Keras, just set ***activation=\"selu\"***.

Its definition is given in Equation below, where Φ is the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function (CDF): Φ(z) corresponds to the probability that a value sampled randomly from a normal distribution of mean 0 and variance 1 is lower than z.\n",

    "GELU resembles ReLU: it approaches 0 when its input z is very negative, and it approaches z when z is very positive. However, whereas all the activation functions we’ve discussed so far were both convex and monotonic, the GELU activation function is neither: from left to right, it starts by going straight, then it wiggles down, reaches a low point around –0.17 (near z ≈ –0.75), and finally bounces up and ends up going straight toward the top right. This fairly complex shape and the fact that it has a curvature at every point may explain why it works so well, especially for complex tasks: gradient descent may find it easier to fit complex patterns. In practice, it often outperforms every other activation function discussed so far. However, it is a bit more computationally intensive, and the performance boost it provides is not always sufficient to justify the extra cost. That said, it is possible to show that it is approximately equal to zσ(1.702 z), where σ is the sigmoid function: using this approximation also works very well, and it has the advantage of being much faster to compute.\n",

Interestingly, a ***2017 paper(https://homl.info/swish)*** by Prajit Ramachandran et al. rediscovered the SiLU function by automatically searching for good activation functions. The authors named it Swish, and the name caught on. In their paper, Swish outperformed every other function, including GELU. Ramachandran et al. later generalized Swish by adding an extra hyperparameter β to scale the sigmoid function’s input. The generalized Swish function is ***Swish<sub>β</sub>(z) = zσ(βz)***, so GELU is approximately equal to the generalized Swish function using β = 1.702. You can tune β like any other hyperparameter. Alternatively, it’s also possible to make β trainable and let gradient descent optimize it: much like PReLU, this can make your model more powerful, but it also runs the risk of overfitting the data.\n",

Just like GELU and Swish, it is a smooth, nonconvex, and nonmonotonic variant of ReLU, and once again the author ran many experiments and found that Mish generally outperformed other activation functions—even Swish and GELU, by a tinymargin.\n",

    "> So, which activation function should you use for the hidden layers of your deep neural networks? ReLU remains a good default for simple tasks: it’s often just as good as the more sophisticated activation functions, plus it’s very fast to compute, and many libraries and hardware accelerators provide ReLU-specific optimizations. However, Swish is probably a better default for more complex tasks, and you can even try parametrized Swish with a learnable β parameter for the most complex tasks. Mish may give you slightly better results, but it requires a bit more compute. If you care a lot about runtime latency, then you may prefer leaky ReLU, or parametrized leaky ReLU for more complex tasks. For deep MLPs, give SELU a try, but make sure to respect the constraints listed earlier. If you have spare time and computing power, you can use cross-validation to evaluate other activation functions as well.\n",

    "So during training, BN standardizes its inputs, then rescales and offsets them. Good! What about at test time? Well, it’s not that simple. Indeed, we may need to make predictions for individual instances rather than for batches of instances: in this case, we will have no way to compute each input’s mean and standard deviation. Moreover, even if we do have a batch of instances, it may be too small, or the instances may not be independent and identically distributed, so computing statistics over the batch instances would be unreliable. One solution could be to wait until the end of training, then run the whole training set through the neural network and compute the mean and standard deviation of each input of the BN layer. These “final” input means and standard deviations could then be used instead of the batch input means and standard deviations when making predictions. However, most implementations of batch normalization estimate these final statistics during training by using a moving average of the layer’s input means and standard deviations. This is what Keras does automatically when you use the ***BatchNormalization*** layer. To sum up, four parameter vectors are learned in each batch-normalized layer: γ (the output scale vector) and β (the output offset vector) are learned through regular backpropagation, and μ (the final input mean vector) and σ (the final input standard deviation vector) are estimated using an exponential moving average. Note that μ and σ are estimated during training, but they are used only after training (to replace the batch input means and standard deviations in Equation above).\n",

    "Ioffe and Szegedy demonstrated that batch normalization considerably improved all the deep neural networks they experimented with, leading to a huge improvement in the ImageNet classification task (ImageNet is a large database of images classified into many classes, commonly used to evaluate computer vision systems). The vanishing gradients problem was strongly reduced, to the point that they could use saturating activation functions such as the tanh and even the sigmoid activation function. The networks were also much less sensitive to the weight initialization. The authors were able to use much larger learning rates, significantly speeding up the learning process. Specifically, they note that:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, batch normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. […] Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, like a gift that keeps on giving, batch normalization acts like a regularizer, reducing the need for other regularization techniques (such as dropout, described later in this chapter).\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch normalization does, however, add some complexity to the model (although it can remove the need for normalizing the input data, as discussed earlier). Moreover, there is a runtime penalty: the neural network makes slower predictions due to the extra computations required at each layer. Fortunately, it’s often possible to fuse the BN layer with the previous layer after training, thereby avoiding the runtime penalty. This is done byupdating the previous layer’s weights and biases so that it directly produces outputs of the appropriate scale and offset. For example, if the previous layer computes **XW + b**, then the BN layer will compute **γ ⊗ (XW + b – μ) / σ + β** (ignoring the smoothing term ε in the denominator). If we define **W′ = γ⊗W / σ** and **b′ = γ ⊗ (b – μ) / σ + β**, the equation simplifies to **XW′ + b′**. So, if we replace the previous layer’s weights and biases (**W** and **b**) with the updated weights and biases (W′ and b′), we can get rid of the BN layer (TFLite’s converter does this automatically; see Chapter 19).\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### **NOTE**\n",
    "> You may find that training is rather slow, because each epoch takes much more time when you use batch normalization. This is usually counterbalanced by the fact that convergence is much faster with BN, so it will take fewer epochs to reach the same performance. All in all, wall time will usually be shorter (this is the time measured by the clock on your wall)."

    "As with most things with Keras, implementing batch normalization is straightforward and intuitive. Just add a ***BatchNormalization*** layer before or after each hidden layer’s activation function. You may also add a BN layer as the first layer in your model, but a plain ***Normalization*** layer generally performs just as well in this location (its only drawback is that you must first call its ***adapt()*** method). For example, this model applies BN after every hidden layer and as the first layer in the model (after flattening the input images):"

There is some debate about this, as which is preferable seems to depend on the task—you can experiment with this too to see which option works best on your dataset. To add the BN layers before the activation function, you must remove the activation functions from the hidden layers and add them as separate layers after the BN layers. Moreover, since a batch normalization layer includes one offset parameter per input, you can remove the bias term from the previous layer by passing ***use_bias=False*** when creating it.

    "Another important hyperparameter is ***axis***: it determines which axis should be normalized. It defaults to –1, meaning that by default it will normalize the last axis (using the means and standard deviations computed across the other axes). When the input batch is 2D (i.e., the batch shape is [batch size, features]), this means that each input feature will be normalized based on the mean and standard deviation computed across all the instances in the batch. For example, the first BN layer in the previous code example will independently normalize (and rescale and shift) each of the 784 input features. If we move the first BN layer before the ***Flatten*** layer, then the input batches will be 3D, with shape [***batch size, height, width***]; therefore, the BN layer will compute 28 means and 28 standard deviations (1 per column of pixels, computed across all instances in the batch and across all rows in the column), and it will normalize all pixels in a given column using the same mean and standard deviation. There will also be just 28 scale parameters and 28 shift parameters. If instead you still want to treat each of the 784 pixels independently, then you should set ***axis=[1, 2]***.\n",

    "This optimizer will clip every component of the gradient vector to a value between –1.0 and 1.0. This means that all the partial derivatives of the loss (with regard to each and every trainable parameter) will be clipped between–1. and 1.0. The threshold is a hyperparameter you can tune. Note that it may change the orientation of the gradient vector. For instance, if the original gradient vector is [0.9, 100.0], it points mostly in the direction of the second axis; but once you clip it by value, you get [0.9, 1.0], which points roughly at the diagonal between the two axes. In practice, this approach works well. If you want to ensure that gradient clipping does not change the direction of the gradient vector, you should clip by norm by setting ***clipnorm*** instead of ***clipvalue***. This will clip the whole 2 gradient if its ℓ norm is greater than the threshold you picked. For example, if you set ***clipnorm=1.0***, then the vector [0.9, 100.0] will be clipped to [0.00899964, 0.9999595], preserving its orientation but almost eliminating the first component. If you observe that the gradients explode during training (you can track the size of the gradients using TensorBoard), you may want to try clipping by value or clipping by norm, with different thresholds, and see which option performs best on the validation set."

    "It is generally not a good idea to train a very large DNN from scratch without first trying to find an existing neural network that accomplishes a similar task to the one you are trying to tackle (I will discuss how to findthem in Chapter 14). If you find such as neural network, then you can generally reuse most of its layers, except for the top ones. This technique is called ***transfer learning***. It will not only speed up training considerably, but also requires significantly less training data.\n",

It is also useful to reduce the learning rate when you unfreeze reused layers: this will avoid wrecking their fine-tuned weights.\n",

You now want to tackle a different task: you have images of T-shirts and pullovers, and you want to train a binary classifier: positive for T-shirts (and tops), negative for sandals. Your dataset is quite small; you only have 200 labeled images. When you train a new model for this task (let’s call it model B) with the same architecture as model A, you get 91.85% test accuracy. While drinking your morning coffee, you realize that your task is quite similar to task A, so perhaps transfer learning can help?

Ifyou try to change the classes or the random seed, you will see that the improvement generally drops, or even vanishes or reverses. What I did is called “torturing the data until it confesses”. When a paper just looks too positive, you should be suspicious: perhaps the flashy new technique does not actually help much (in fact, it may even degrade performance), but the authors tried many variants and reported only the best results (which may be due to sheer luck), without mentioning how many failures they encountered on the way. Most of the time, this is not malicious at all, but it is part of the reason so many results in science can never be reproduced. Why did I cheat? It turns out that transfer learning does not work very well with small dense networks, presumably because small networks learn few patterns, and dense networks learn very specific patterns, which are unlikely to be useful in other tasks. Transfer learning works best with deep convolutional neural networks, which tend to learn feature detectors that are much more general (especially in the lower layers). We will revisit transfer learning in Chapter 14, using the techniques we just discussed (and this time there will be no cheating, I promise!)."

    "Suppose you want to tackle a complex task for which you don’t have much labeled training data, but unfortunately you cannot find a model trained on a similar task. Don’t lose hope! First, you should try to gather more labeled training data, but if you can’t, you may still be able to perform ***unsupervised pretraining***. Indeed, it is often cheap to gather unlabeled training examples, but expensive to label them. If you can gather plenty of unlabeled training data, you can try to use it to train an unsupervised model, such as an autoencoder or a generative adversarial network (GAN; see Chapter 17). Then you can reuse the lower layers of the autoencoder or the lower layers of the GAN’s discriminator, add the output layer for your task on top, and fine-tune the final network using supervised learning (i.e., with the labeled training examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is this technique that Geoffrey Hinton and his team used in 2006, and which led to the revival of neural networks and the success of deeplearning. Until 2010, unsupervised pretraining—typically with restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs; see the notebook at *https://homl.info/extraanns*)—was the norm for deep nets, and only after the vanishing gradients problem was alleviated did it become much more common to train DNNs purely using supervised learning. Unsupervised pretraining (today typically using autoencoders or GANs rather than RBMs) is still a good option when you have a complex task to solve, no similar model you can reuse, and little labeled training data but plenty of unlabeled training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the early days of deep learning it was difficult to train deep models, so people would use a technique called ***greedy layer-wise pretraining***. They would first train an unsupervised model with a single layer, typically an **RBM**, then they would freeze that layer and add another one on top of it, then train the model again (effectively just training the new layer), then freeze the new layer and add another layer on top of it, train the model again, and so on. Nowadays, things are much simpler: people generally train the full unsupervised model in one shot and use autoencoders or **GAN**s rather than **RBM**s.\n"

If you can train a model to reach good performance on this task, then it will already know quite a lot about language, and you can certainly reuse it for your actual task and fine-tune it on your labeled data (we will discuss more pretraining tasks in Chapter 15).\n",

    "## **Faster Optimizers**\n",
    "Training a very large deep neural network can be painfully slow. So far we have seen four ways to speed up training (and reach a better solution): applying a good initialization strategy for the connection weights, using a good activation function, using batch normalization, and reusing parts of a pretrained network (possibly built for an auxiliary task or using unsupervised learning). Another huge speed boost comes from using a faster optimizer than the regular gradient descent optimizer. In this section we will present the most popular optimization algorithms: momentum, Nesterov accelerated gradient, AdaGrad, RMSProp, and finally Adam and its variants."

    "Imagine a bowling ball rolling down a gentle slope on a smooth surface: it will start out slowly, but it will quickly pick up momentum until it eventually reaches terminal velocity (if there is some friction or air resistance). This is the core idea behind momentum optimization, proposed by ***Boris Polyak in 1964(https://homl.info/54)***.  In contrast, regular gradient descent will take small steps when the slope is gentle and big steps when the slope is steep, but it will never pick up speed. As a result, regular gradient descent is generally much slower to reach the minimum than momentum optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that gradient descent updates the weights **θ** by directly subtracting the gradient of the cost function ***J(θ)*** with regard to the weights (***∇<sub>θ</sub>J(θ)***) multiplied by the learning rate η. The equation is ***θ ← θ – η∇<sub>θ</sub>J(θ)***. It does not care about what the earlier gradients were. If the local gradient is tiny, it goes very slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum optimization cares a great deal about what previous gradients were: at each iteration, it subtracts the local gradient from the momentum vector **m** (multiplied by the learning rate η), and it updates the weights by adding this momentum vector (see Equation below). In other words, the gradient is used as an acceleration, not as a speed. To simulate some sort of friction mechanism and prevent the momentum from growing too large, the algorithm introduces a new hyperparameter β, called the momentum, which must be set between 0 (high friction) and 1 (no friction). A typical momentum value is 0.9.\n",

    "You can verify that if the gradient remains constant, the terminal velocity (i.e., the maximum size of the weight updates) is equal to that gradient multiplied by the learning rate η multiplied by 1 / (1 – β) (ignoring the sign). For example, if β = 0.9, then the terminal velocity is equal to 10 times the gradient times the learning rate, so momentum optimization ends up going 10 times faster than gradient descent! This allows momentum optimization to escape from plateaus much faster than gradient descent. We saw in Chapter 4 that when the inputs have very different scales, the cost function will look like an elongated bowl (see Figure 4-7). Gradient descent goes down the steep slope quite fast, but then it takes a very long time to go down the valley. In contrast, momentum optimization will roll down the valley faster and faster until it reaches the bottom (the optimum). In deep neural networks that don’t use batch normalization, the upper layers will often end up having inputs with very different scales, so using momentum optimization helps a lot. It can also help roll past local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### **NOTE**\n",
    ">  Due to the momentum, the optimizer may overshoot a bit, then come back, overshoot again, and oscillate like this many times before stabilizing at the minimum.

    "Finding a good learning rate is very important. If you set it much too high, training may diverge (as discussed in “Gradient Descent”). If you set it too low, training will eventually converge to the optimum, but it will take a very long time. If you set it slightly too high, it will make progress very quickly at first, but it will end up dancing around the optimum and never really settling down. If you have a limited computing budget, you may have to interrupt training before it has converged properly, yielding a suboptimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in Chapter 10, you can find a good learning rate by training the model for a few hundred iterations, exponentially increasing the learning rate from a very small value to a very large value, and then looking at the learning curve and picking a learning rate slightly lower than the one at which the learning curve starts shooting back up. You can then reinitialize your model and train it with that learning rate.\n",

There are many different strategies to reduce the learning rate during training. It can also be beneficial to start with a low learning rate, increase it, then drop it again. These strategies are called learning schedules (I briefly introduced this concept in Chapter 4). These are the most commonly used learning schedules:\n",

After ***s*** more steps it is down to ***η<sub>0</sub> / 3***, then it goes down to ***η<sub>0</sub> / 4***, then ***η<sub>0</sub> / 5***, and so on.

    "     1cycle was introduced in a ***2018 paper(https://homl.info/1cycle)*** by Leslie Smith.  Contrary to the other approaches, it starts by increasing the initial learning rate η , growing linearly up to ***η<sub>1</sub>*** halfway through training. Then it decreases the learning rate linearly down to ***η<sub>0</sub>*** again during the second half of training, finishing the last few epochs by dropping the rate down by several orders of magnitude (still linearly). The maximum learning rate ***η<sub>1</sub>*** is chosen using the same approach we used to find the optimal learning rate, and the initial learning rate ***η<sub>0</sub>*** is usually 10 times lower. When using a momentum, we start with a high momentum first (e.g.,0.95), then drop it down to a lower momentum during the first half of training (e.g., down to 0.85, linearly), and then bring it back up to the maximum value (e.g., 0.95) during the second half of training, finishing the last few epochs with that maximum value. Smith did many experiments showing that this approach was often able to speed up training considerably and reach better performance. For example, on the popular CIFAR10 image dataset, this approach reached 91.9% validation accuracy in just 100 epochs, compared to 90.3% accuracy in 800 epochs through a standard approach (with the same neural network architecture). This feat was dubbed ***super-convergence***.\n",

They favored exponential scheduling because it was easy to tune and it converged slightly faster to the optimal solution. They also mentioned that it was easier to implement than performance scheduling, but in Keras both options are easy. That said, the 1cycle approach seems to perform even better.\n",

    "### **Dropout**\n",
    "***Dropout*** is one of the most popular regularization techniques for deep neural networks. It was *proposed in a paper(https://homl.info/64)*  by Geoffrey Hinton et al. in 2012 and further detailed in a *2014 paper(https://homl.info/65)*  by Nitish Srivastava et al., and it has proven to be highly successful: many state-of-the-art neural networks use dropout, as it gives them a 1%–2% accuracy boost. This may not sound like a lot, but when a model already has 95% accuracy, getting a 2% accuracy boost means dropping the error rate by almost 40% (going from 5% error to roughly 3%).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron (including the input neurons, but always excluding the output neurons) has a probability p of being temporarily “dropped out”, meaning it will be entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active during the next step. The hyperparameter p is called the dropout rate, and it is typically set between 10% and 50%: closer to 20%–30% in recurrent neural nets (see Chapter 15), and closer to 40%–50% in convolutional neural networks (see Chapter 14). After training, neurons don’t get dropped anymore. And that’s all (except for a technical detail we will discuss momentarily).\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s surprising at first that this destructive technique works at all. Would a company perform better if its employees were told to toss a coin every morning to decide whether or not to go to work? Well, who knows; perhaps it would! The company would be forced to adapt its organization; it could not rely on any single person to work the coffee machine or perform any other critical tasks, so this expertise would have to be spread across several people. Employees would have to learn to cooperate with many of their coworkers, not just a handful of them. The company would become muchmore resilient. If one person quit, it wouldn’t make much of a difference. It’s unclear whether this idea would actually work for companies, but it certainly does for neural networks. Neurons trained with dropout cannot coadapt with their neighboring neurons; they have to be as useful as possible on their own. They also cannot rely excessively on just a few input neurons; they must pay attention to each of their input neurons. They end up being less sensitive to slight changes in the inputs. In the end, you get a more robust network that generalizes better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to understand the power of dropout is to realize that a unique neural network is generated at each training step. Since each neuron can be either present or absent, there are a total of 2<sup>N</sup> possible networks (where N is the total number of droppable neurons). This is such a huge number that it is virtually impossible for the same neural network to be sampled twice. Once you have run 10,000 training steps, you have essentially trained 10,000 different neural networks, each with just one training instance. These neural networks are obviously not independent because they share many of their weights, but they are nevertheless all different. The resulting neural network can be seen as an averaging ensemble of all these smaller neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### **TIP**\n",
    ">  In practice, you can usually apply dropout only to the neurons in the top one to three layers (excluding the output layer).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one small but important technical detail. Suppose p = 75%: on average only 25% of all neurons are active at each step during training. This means that after training, a neuron would be connected to four times as many input neurons as it would be during training. To compensate for this fact, we need to multiply each neuron’s input connection weights by four during training. If we don’t, the neural network will not perform well as it will see different data during and after training. More generally, we need to divide the connection weights by the keep probability (1 – p) during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement dropout using Keras, you can use the ***tf.keras.layers.Dropout*** layer. During training, it randomly drops some inputs (setting them to 0) and divides the remaining inputs by the keep probability. After training, it does nothing at all; it just passes the inputs to the next layer. The following code applies dropout regularization before every dense layer, using a dropout rate of 0.2:"

We just make 100 predictions over the test set, and we compute their average. More specifically, each call to the model returns a matrix with one row per instance and one column per class. Because there are 10,000 instances in the test set and 10 classes, this is a matrix of shape [10000, 10]. We stack 100 such matrices, so ***y_probas*** is a 3D array of shape [100, 10000, 10]. Once we average over the first dimension (***axis=0***) we get ***y_proba***, an array of shape [10000, 10], like we would get with a single prediction.That’s all! Averaging over multiple predictions with dropout turned on gives us a Monte Carlo estimate that is generally more reliable than the result of a single prediction with dropout turned off.
